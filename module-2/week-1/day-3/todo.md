- today's topic may feel unrelated ... so far !

- why data persistency ? (ex: localstorage vs database)
- DBMS > mySQL, mariadb, postgre, oracle || cassandra, firebase, mongo ...
- SQL / NOSQL ?

- SQL (legacy: 1970 ... ) : STRUCTURED QUERY LANGAGE
- NOSQL : NOT ONLY SQL
- you already know db : the spreadsheet detour
- JSON/BSON
- compass intro playground


you => user => accounts (paid) => get access to the services you paid for !

but how can the app know what you paid for ?

... trough data persistency :D


4 actions possible with data persistency ...

CREATE data
READ   data
UPDATE data
DELETE data


2 options

1 - use files (:/ ... it's slow to write/read/modify files directly)
2 - database ( :) fast, secured and distributed over the web by design)


! YAY let's uses databases !
